## Overview 
<!-- ![Animation of a bulk wave](https://github.com/dulte/FrictionProject/blob/master/examples/bulkwave.gif) -->

The aim of this project is to investigate how friction behaves at a microscopic level. The simulation code is available in the `simulate` directory, analysis scripts in `analysis`, some handy scripts and programs in `utilities`, and some examples in the directory `examples`.

## Usage

The source code for the simulation is in the folder `simulation`, along with a `CMakeLists.txt` to make the program using cmake. Compilation requires cmake >= 3.1, and C++11. No external libraries are used, except for testing. Once satisfied, the makefile can be generated by

```console
cmake .
```
The available options for cmake are listed below.

| Argument | Function |
| -------- | -------- |
| `-DTEST` | Turn on the building of the test suite using `gtest` (Not implemented yet) |
| `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` | Set the build type and the compilation flags. Available options are `DEBUG`, and `RELEASE`, where the latter is the standard|
| `-DCORES` | Specify the number of cores to be used. Defaults to 4 |

Once built, the executable `simulate` requires an input directory containing two files: a parameter file and a lattice structure file. An example of a parameter file is found in `simulate/input/parameters.txt`. The lattice structure file must be generated either by hand or by using the script `utilities/constructLattice.py`. 

Running `simulate` will generate an output directory `output` which where the result of the simulation is stored.

## Analysis scripts

Several analysis scripts are available in the `analysis` directory, the most useful of which is `analyze.py`.  This is used to easily analyze the data from a simulation. To do so, simply type `python analyze.py PATH_TO_OUTPUT`.
